	<h2>HTML</h2>
		<p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. This computer based language uses "tags", which are letter and number combinations or words used in angle brackets. 
		These are used to edit/design text styles. This is all used to create and customize different webpages.</p>

	<h2>HTML5</h2>
		<p>HTML5 stands for Hypertext Markup Language revision 5, it is the new version of the standard HTML, supporting more markup (tags), api's, and more on the Web.
		One of the big reasons HTML5 is making HTML obsolete is that it allows JavaScript to run in the background, as well as including audio and video tags.</p>

	<h2>CSS</h2>
		<p>CSS stands for A Cascading Style Sheet, it helps with displaying fonts, colors, and more in HTML on the Web.
		It is generally linked through HTML and holds most of the "style" for that webpage, this helps to keep a clean looking mark-up page.</p>
