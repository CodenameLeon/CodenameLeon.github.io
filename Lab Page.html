 <h3 id="Lab5" class="Titles">Lab 5</h3>

 <p class="Info">This is Lab 5, this lab I looked at web design principles. 
I tried to keep the web page very simple and keep the content condensed. What I really tried to do
in this lab was experiment with making a drop-down navagtion bar. I had a lot of trouble getting it to work,
but after looking through the web and looking at other mark-up I finally, more or less, got it to work.</p>

 <h3  id="Lab6" class="Titles">Lab 6</h3>

copied it, and had two individual CSS files for each. I experimented a lot with margins and float for one page of this assignemnt,
I worked on putting the images to the left of the text on the page. On the other pages, I spent time 
making a fixed horizontal navigation bar.</p>
