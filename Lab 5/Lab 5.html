			<h2>Web Design</h2>
	
			<p>It is easy to find websites that showcase ways to design your own website, it might be templates, the mark-up language itself, 
			or even a fill in the blank style. You can look at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/">W3 Schools</a> website to check out 
			all three examples.
			
			Another wesbite that helps display and discuss web design principles is <a href="https://www.codecademy.com">Code Academy</a>.
			This website allows users to actively practice and learn web design. </p>

	<h2>Good Web Design</h2>
		
		
		<p>Today good web design is a lot easier to find, with virtually every company
		relying on the internet a good website is a must. One can simply look at the 
		popular social media sites, shopping sites, and others that rely almost entirely on 
		their website. Simply take a look at <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon's</a> website,
		millions of people traffic the site everyday and ease of use plays a big role in that.<br/>
		
		</br><a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple's</a> website is another one that showcases good design, but in a different way than Amazon.
		Apple is built of the design of being simple and sleek, their website sure enough follows suit.
		By just giving the user a simple overview of their newest products on the home page, in a vertical format,
		one can easily look and then scroll to the next one. The page remains uncluttered, by showing each product
		in its own space and a fixed navigation bar for easy navigating.</p>

		<h2>Bad Web Design</h2>
			<p>These websites showcase what not to do when designing a website, first look at a page from  <a href="http://www.csun.edu/~hcedu013/eslplans.html">CSUN</a>,
			you have to wonder if this was done on purpose and just left, or if something in the code went haywire and was never fixed? Another example of bad web design
			can be found on <a href="http://www.gentlegiantsdogfood.com/">gentle giants dog food's</a> website. This website looks like it was started and just never completed.
			With a bunch of "your text here" and "edit text here"  locations, one could make a safe bet on that..</p>
